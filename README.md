# Simple-Linear-Regression-Salary-Data
A simple linear regression model to predict salary based on years of experience using R

This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model using R to predict salary based on years of experience.

## Dataset
The dataset `Salary_Data.csv` contains two columns:
- `YearsExperience`: Number of years of experience.
- `Salary`: Salary corresponding to the experience level.

## Steps in the project:
- Load the dataset.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Fit a linear regression model to the training set.
- Predict salaries on the test set.
- Visualize the results for both the training and testing sets.

## Requirements
- R programming
- Libraries: `caTools`, `ggplot2`

## Visualizations
- Scatter plots and regression lines for both training and test sets to show the model's performance.

## How to run:
1. Install necessary libraries using `install.packages()`.
2. Run the script `SimpleLinearRegression.R` in RStudio or any R IDE.
3. Load the dataset and execute the code to visualize the results.
